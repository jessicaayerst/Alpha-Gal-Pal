# Alpha-Gal Pal

This application was created to help people with Alpha-Gal allergy (red meat allergy) keep track of their symptoms, so that they may communicate more fully with medical professionals. It is also geared to collect user data (with permission) so that more information about the allergy and the people suffering from it can be utilized by researchers.

## Motivation

 Alpha-Gal allergy is a little-known tick-borne illness that is affecting more and more people every year. Like Lymes Disease, Alpha-Gal is often misdiagnosed, and it can be fatal. Since so little information about Alpha-Gal allergy exists, this project is an attempt to spread awareness about the disease, while also offering support to the people suffering from it.
